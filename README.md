**Cardiac Arrest Data Analysis (Heart Disease Detection)**  
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a cardiac arrest dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to heart disease. The goal is to understand which features are most associated with heart disease, using visualization and statistical techniques. 


📁 Dataset Overview  
* Total Records: 1,025  
* Features: 14 (including target variable)  
* Target Variable: target  
   1. indicates presence of heart disease
   2. 0 indicates absence of heart disease
